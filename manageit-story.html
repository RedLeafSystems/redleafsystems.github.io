          <h2>Building the app</h2>
          <p>
Hi, I'm Ben, and today, I'll be showcasing ManageIt, an inventory application that I made for my family
to keep track of the food we have. While it may seem like a simple concept, it was harder than you might
think to implement it all.

<br><br>

But let's begin before I started making this app. Why did we even need it in the first place? Well… my
family used to have one freezer, a small one. But as my brother and I got older, we needed more food, and
much of it was seasonal and not easily obtainable, so we needed to stockpile. Therefore, we got another
freezer, a medium sized one. Then we discovered the UBC farm blueberry u-pick, where we could pick our
own organic blueberries. As the years went by, we got better and better at picking, easily doing over 75
pounds of berries in a single day. This produced a lot of blueberries, and therefore, we needed to store
them somewhere so we could have a good supply of frozen blueberries over the year. We bought another freezer,
a large one, and yet another freezer. We now have 6 freezers in our house, filled with blueberries,
raspberries, bread from the farmer's market, and much, much more! Then we had lists, and lists of lists,
to keep track of all the items we had. There were lists for each freezer and lists comprising things spread
across multiple freezers. And there were crossed out items, and things that no one could decipher, and
duplicates, and, of course, nothing was sorted. How would we know when we were close to running out of
a certain item? I decided that I needed to build an app to fix this problem. I needed it to have categories,
for example, meals, or vegetables. Inside each category would be items, each with a name, count and date,
(for example, blackberry puree, 5, June 5th, 2025).

<br><br>

Now for the actual building of the app. I had two main programming languages I could build the app in -- Java
or C#. After much consideration, I decided to go with C# as I generally find Java to be buggier and less
intuitive to work with. Then, I had to pick the SDK (software development kit) that I would be working with.
An SDK is what helps you build your app by giving you pre-built components like buttons. There were two
options: .NET MAUI and UNO Platform. Since both are pretty much identical for everything except for styling,
I picked the one that I found the most aesthetically pleasing -- .NET MAUI. Then, I got coding.

<br><br>

First, I had to lay out all the components for my app. A header, buttons, text labels, and a large data grid
for showing the categories' items. But the components, of course, were all blank and did nothing when pressed.
It was time to code! I started by implementing some basic logic, ignoring the categories and just focusing on
creating, editing and deleting items. After much trial and error, I got that part working. Then I went to
implement the categories, but found that the entire backend of the code (all the variables and lists that
I'd setup for storing the items) had to be entirely redone to allow for them to be placed in categories.
After that, I had to implement autosaving of the data, so when you closed the app, your categories and items
wouldn't be lost.

<br><br>

Then came the testing. Testing is (in my opinion) probably the most stressful part of making an app, as it
determines how many hours you have to spend debugging issues, which is a pretty painful process if the issues
aren't obvious (as they mostly aren't). Surprisingly, while undergoing testing, I saw relatively few issues.
I colored all the elements in my app with bright, garish colors so as to make figuring out which component
was where easier. There were a number of glitches, but they were easily fixable, except for one -- the main
grid of items within a category refused to size on its vertical axis correctly, and I couldn't seem to change
it. I still haven't figured out a way to do it, as it seems to be an bug with the control itself and not
anything I can change.

<br><br>

And with that, the app was ready for release -- kind of. I still had to remove a bunch of functions and checks
that I had put into the code for testing and debugging. I reverted the component's colours to more tasteful
ones. After I did that, I could produce an APK file -- a file that would, when run on an Android device,
install the application via a process called sideloading. When you want to get an app on an Android phone,
you have to get it via one of two processes -- sideloading or the Google Play Store. The Google Play Store
is similar to the Apple App Store in the way that you search for an app that you want, click a button to
install it, and boom! It's on your device. In order for an app to appear on the Google Play Store, the
developer must pay a fee and get their app verified by Google. This ensures that most apps on the Play Store
are safe, (though there are several cases where malware has slipped through). Sideloading an app is more
complicated and dangerous, as there is no virus scanning. Developers who do not want to verify with Google
or pay the fee to be on the Play Store can publish an APK file to a website. An Android user can download
the APK file, then allow some restricted permissions in the device settings, and install the APK directly.
This is what is known as sideloading. The app, once installed, would behave like it was downloaded from the
Play Store. Google is trying to make APK developers verify with their IDs before their apps can be installed
onto a device, which is causing a lot of controversy. But that's beside the point.

<br><br>

<b>So... here's the result:</b>
<br>
When we open the app for the first time, it creates a sample item in a sample category, but we can add new
items using the plus button at the bottom, edit them by pressing on them, and delete them by pressing on
them and selecting "delete". For categories, we can switch them using the switch button and pick a category
to load. We can edit the name of a category by clicking on "edit", and add one by clicking on "add". All
this data is autosaved, which is shown via the bar on the top of the screen. When we close the app, all our
changes have been saved to a file, which will be ready for loading when we next launch the app.

          <video
            id="my-video"
            class="video-js vjs-theme-sea"
            controls
            preload="auto"
            data-setup="{}"
            style="width: 100%; max-width: 100%;">
            <source src="assets/media/App running.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
            <p class="vjs-no-js">

              supports HTML5 video.</p>
          </video>

          <br><br>

          <p>
That's all for my project. While it's still a work in progress, I think I've done really good work on it so
far and am happy with the current result!

<br><br>

In the future, I want to be able to enable sorting of items by name and date. I want to fix the bug with the
grid of items going off the bottom of the screen. And, of course, I want to add more animations, optimize
loading times as doing some actions sometimes causes the app to lag slightly, and finally, make the app look
slightly more polished. Then I want to implement saving the items to an internet-connected database so multiple
devices can edit the data. But that's all for a future release! For now, it still has most of the functions
my family need.

          <h2>Creation of this personal project</h2>
          <p>
            To create this Personal Project, I first noted down all the steps I had taken when building
            the app in point form. Then I expanded on them and wrote a paragraph or more for each one.
            I tried my best to explain it simply, so that anyone could understand it, even people less
            experienced with technology. After that, I needed to record myself speaking through the script.
            I had a microphone, but I didn't have a stand for it, so I created a custom model for it and
            3D printed it using my 3D printer. Then, I recorded myself speaking through the script, messed
            up the audio quality, and re-recorded it. Once I'd done that, I started to edit together a video,
            but decided that it was easier and more effective to make a website showcasing the project instead.
            I made the website using HTML and CSS for the layout and styling, and a bit of JavaScript for interactivity.
            Finally, I added images and a video to illustrate the app and its features.
